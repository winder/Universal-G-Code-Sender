Universal GcodeSender is a Java based GRBL compatible cross platform G-Code sender. Use this program to run a GRBL controlled CNC machine.

Online documentation available here: http://winder.github.io/ugs_website/
<br />
Documentation contributions can be made here: https://github.com/winder/ugs_website

To run simply unzip the .zip file and double click the .jar file.
On some platforms you will need to run an included start script.

Note for MAC users:
For version 1.0.8 and earlier you may need to create a "/var/lock" directory on OSX to fix a bug in the serial
library. To do this open the Terminal application and run the following two
commands:
<br />
   sudo mkdir /var/lock
<br />
   sudo chmod 777 /var/lock
<br />

Technical details:
* JSSC for serial communication (RXTX was used up through v1.0.8)
* JogAmp for OpenGL.
* Developed with NetBeans 8.0.2 or later.

Development
-----------

For development the [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) build tool is used.

#### Run main class from command line

```mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.willwinder.universalgcodesender.MainWindow"```


#### Execute all tests

```mvn test```


#### Just build a self-running uber-jar:

```mvn package```


#### Build a UniversalGcodeSender.zip release file

```mvn package assembly:assembly```
