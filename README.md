Universal GcodeSender is a Java based GRBL compatible cross platform G-Code sender. Use this program to run a GRBL controlled CNC machine.

To run simply unzip the .zip file and double click the .jar file.
On some platforms you will need to run an included start script.

Note for MAC users:
For version 1.0.8 and earlier you may need to create a "/var/lock" directory on OSX to fix a bug in the serial
library. To do this open the Terminal application and run the following two
commands:
<br />
   sudo mkdir /var/lock
<br />
   sudo chmod 777 /var/lock
<br />

Technical details:
* JSSC for serial communication (RXTX was used up through v1.0.8)
* JogAmp for OpenGL.
* Utilizes One-Jar to bundle all dependencies into a single runnable .jar file.
* Developed with NetBeans 8.0.2 or later.
