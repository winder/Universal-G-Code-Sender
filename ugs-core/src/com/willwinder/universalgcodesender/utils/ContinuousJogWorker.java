     * on the algorithm described here: https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki/Grbl-v1.1-Jogging
     * The algorithm has been simplified by reducing consideration for:
     *    dt > v^2 / (2 * a * (N-1))
     * Instead, we make some assumptions that are expected for good jog performance:
     *  1) The latency from when we send a jog command to GRBL and receive the "ok" back is less than 10ms (typically 1-7ms).
     *  2) The Jog feedrate and machine acceleration are such that the machine can accelerate to it's full jog rate within
     *     the length of the command buffer (N=15 for regular GRBL).
     *  3) The command buffer isn't larger than N=15 (if it is, we'll get increasing lag in response to direction/rate changes on the joystick)
     * command to take 10ms to execute excluding acceleration time.
     *
     * Note: the jog command total feedrate may exceed the set feedrate if moving in more than one axis at the same time. The max rate
     * in any 1 axis will never exceed the jog feedrate.
