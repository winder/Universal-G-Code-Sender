<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to Universal Gcode Sender - If this is your first time using UGS thanks for giving it a try.
    This window is here to help you get started, once you are comfortable with the basic sending functionality please
    explore the other tabs to learn about the other features that this software has to offer.
</p>

<p>
    <h2>Opening a file</h2>
    Open your gcode file from the <a href="open">file menu</a>. Once the file is loaded, there are a
    number of things you can do with it: inspect the tool paths from the Visualizer, edit them using the
    built in editor, see the number of rows in the program in the status bar.
    UGS is a great way to preview your tool paths even if you are not ready to run the program yet!<br/><br/>

<p>
    <h2>Connecting to a controller</h2>
    When you are ready to connect to your machine, the serial connection can be
    configured in the toolbar at the top of the program. Choose your firmware from the combo box and configure the
    serial options accordingly. If you have not yet configured your controller you may be interested in the <b>Setup wizard</b>
    found in the Machine menu to help you set it up.
</p>
<p>
    Once connected you can use UGS to control your machine. Some good places to start are the Jog Controller,
    manually sending commands in the console, or working with the coordinate system in the <a href="https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender/wiki/Usage#user-content-digital-read-out">DRO</a>. You can find more information about
    features and how to use them <a href="https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender/wiki/Usage">here</a>.<br/><br/>

<p>
    <h2>Running your machine</h2>
    Once you have loaded a file and established a connection to your controller, the program may be run. These
    icons in the toolbar can be used to stream, pause, and stopping the program.<br/><br/>
