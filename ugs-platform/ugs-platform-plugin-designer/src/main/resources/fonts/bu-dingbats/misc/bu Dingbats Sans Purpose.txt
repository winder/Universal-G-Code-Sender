bu Dingbats Sans Purpose

A Sunday evening distraction

Ok, I was not in the mood to do my chores and not looking forward to a lousy Monday work day, so I grabbed my scotch and did a dingbat. Here it is, be as it may. I'm still under the influence, and still not looking forward to work tomorrow, but the dingbat is done. Do with it as you will, hopefully you can have fun wiht it.
