This is a dingbat font with over 60 silhouettes of the creatures that scare us - insects, flying bugs, spiders, snakes, lizards, rodents, birds and more.

Each glyph has a mirrored counterpart between the upper and lower cases (as well as the numerals/punctuation). 
There are additional silhouettes available in the extended character set.

Use of a character map program, such as Windows' Character Map, will be very helpful in exploring and using this font.
